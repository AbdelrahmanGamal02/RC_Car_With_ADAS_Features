# RC_Car_With_ADAS_Features
- The project is about how to use AVR microcontroller to Implement some features of ADAS in RC car.
 
## Features Implemented in the project 

- Cruise Control: use a switch to implement the Cruise Control.
- Adaptive Cruise Control: use a switch and ultrasonic sensor to implement Adaptive Cruise Control.
- Blind spot warning: use 2 PIR sensor to detect any car appeared in the blind spot of the driver.
- Collision warning: use 2 ultrasonic sensors to get the distance between the car and any object and when the distance is less than 10 cm, the buzzer turned on to warn the driver.

I also use the LCD to implement the function of dashboard to warn the driver and display information.
To implement the lighting system of the real car, I used yellow and red Leds to indicate the direction of the car (if car turns left, the left yellow led turn on and so on).
The use of Bluetooth module is interacting the car with mobile phone and implement the steering wheel in the real car.
